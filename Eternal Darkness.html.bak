        <div style="text-align: left;">So.. this is my first jump
          to HTML and maybe a big upgrade for my small hobby of reviewing games.<br>
          <br>
          Eternal Darkness. What an amazing game by a talented team that got
          really unlucky&nbsp;since this game was planned to be on the N64,
          then
          on GameCube where finally was released.<br>
          The delays were definitely worth, the atmosphere is curated and it
          really nailed the H.P Lovecraft settings.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          I really liked the plot, spanning a total of 10 characters including
          the villain that plays a major role in the first chapter by "deciding"
          which god he offers his sacrifices. There are a total of 4 gods:
          <div class="RqBzHd">
            <ul class="i8Z77e">
              <li class="TrT0Xe"><b>Ulyaoth</b>.</li>
              <li class="TrT0Xe"><b>Xel'lotath</b>.</li>
              <li class="TrT0Xe"><b>Chattur'gha</b>.</li>
              <li class="TrT0Xe"><b>Mantorok</b></li>
            </ul>
            This gods are based on a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">rock,
paper,
              scissors </span>system
            that feels really rewarding. &nbsp;Mantorok is hidden in a chapter
            and
            is "limitated" to some spells, but man those are the most powerful
            in
            some cases such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">shield
              spell</span> or the <span style="font-style: italic;">summon
              Horror</span>.<br>
            Every time you cast a spell you have to stand still and wait a
            certain
            amount of time, this wait really ramps up when you get the most
            advanced "circles of power" such as the pentagon or the septagon.<br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 842px; height: 501px;"

            </div>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
                summon system. <br>
                You can discover spells by finding them (every chapter has one)
                or by
                trying new combinations.</span></div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The gameplay is the classic survival horror that everyone loved in
            that
            period, SK definitely understood how to make a polished product. <br>
            The
            camera is mostly static with 3D backgrounds that are rendered in
            time,
            with sporadic moments where a dyamic camera shows
            the hard work done on making smooth turns.<br>
            Every character has
            different stats based on stamina, health, magick and sanity. The
            sanity
            system made this game iconic, when it's running low (by seeing
            monsters) you will start to
            see odd things such as blue screens, getting decapitated when
            casting
            spells or thinking you crossed several rooms just to get
            "teleported"
            back. You can undo those effects by casting magic spells or with
            some
            items such as unique items that some character carry.<br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 842px; height: 501px;"

                src="images/EternalDarkness/GEDE01_2020-09-17_20-40-41.png" alt=""><br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">One of the worst (and
                coolest) sanity effect that can occour. <br>
                <br>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;">The cutscenes are rendered
                in real time and for a 2002 title I feel they're pretty good
                compared
                to most of those games that still used <span style="font-style: italic;">FMV</span>s
                such as Fatal
                Frame. <br>
                The acting is nothing stellar but it gets the job done, and I
                think
                this is really important for a game that heavily focuses on the
                plot.<br>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 542px; height: 363px;"

          src="images/EternalDarkness/GEDE01_2020-09-17_18-23-28.png" alt=""><img style="width: 542px; height: 363px;"

        <br>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">In 16:9 mode the
          cutscenes appear letterboxed. It's a bit annoying, but you will get
          over it.<br>
          <br>
        </span>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Now the only part I didn't like: the
          guardian of the artifact in the WW1 chapter. This boss feels
          impossible
          and frustrating until you understand that you just have to nail the
          timing down, then becomes a cakewalk. I think it could get a bit more
          polish since it's a really cool fight, but take this as a nitpick more
          than else.<br>
          <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
        <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
        </span>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 842px; height: 501px;"

            src="images/EternalDarkness/GEDE01_2020-09-18_22-47-32.png" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">Once you get a bunch of spells,
            every boss battle becomes really interesting, trying multiple ways
            of beating it. <br>
            <br>
          </span>
          <div style="text-align: left;">In the end I really reccomend this
            game, I played it on Dolphin and apart from some stutters it ran
            smoothly on constant 60fps.<br>
            Definitely recommended! <span style="font-weight: bold;">9/10<br>
